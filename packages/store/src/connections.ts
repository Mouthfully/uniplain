/**
 * READING ONE CONNECTION. The other half of the ingest path, and the half that needs no new
 * database object at all.
 *
 * `public.ingest_envelope_rows` took a migration, a role grant and a third `MintedRole` because the
 * WRITE reaches a function in a schema PostgREST cannot see. This read reaches a table in `public`
 * that `authenticated` already holds a `select` grant on, under a policy that already exists:
 * `connections_select` is `to authenticated using (app.can_read_workspace(workspace_id))`, and for
 * a key session `can_read_workspace` opens exactly the workspace the token names. So the isolation
 * here is row-level security doing its job, not this file -- the same property `performance.ts`
 * rests on, and the reason the Worker still holds no service-role key.
 *
 * THE ROW IS WORTH NOTHING WITHOUT THE KEK, WHICH IS THE POINT.
 * `20260908000500_connections.sql` chose envelope encryption over Supabase Vault precisely so that
 * one database compromise is not also a credential compromise: the ciphertext lives here, the key
 * encryption key lives in Cloudflare, and Postgres is never a party to either the plaintext or the
 * DEK. This adapter returns the sealed bytes and cannot open them. `openCredential` in
 * `@repo/connections` can, in the isolate, with a binding this package never sees.
 *
 * THREE THINGS THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO.
 *
 * ONE: IT DOES NOT DECIDE WHETHER THE CONNECTION IS USABLE. `status`, `revoked_at` and
 * `expires_at` are returned verbatim and judged by `connectionHealth` and `openCredential`, which
 * own that question and phrase the refusal in terms a merchant can act on. A second opinion here
 * would be a second place for "is this connection fine?" to be answered, and the two would
 * eventually disagree -- which is the failure `credential_lane` was added to stop one layer down.
 *
 * TWO: IT DOES NOT TELL A CALLER WHY IT FOUND NOTHING. A connection id that does not exist and one
 * that belongs to another workspace are the SAME null. Distinguishing them would turn this into an
 * oracle for which connection ids exist elsewhere, which is a tenancy leak with no upside: the
 * operator holding the ingest secret already knows the pair it typed.
 *
 * THREE: IT LOGS NOTHING. Not the row, not the ciphertext, not a length. Same rule as
 * `callPostgrest`'s: the failure kind travels, the values do not.

/**
 * A connection as the READ path sees it: `ConnectionRow` plus the column the connect path cannot
 * fill in.
 *
 * IT EXTENDS RATHER THAN RESTATES, AND THE FIRST DRAFT DID THE OTHER THING. That draft declared its
 * own fifteen fields with `provider`, `credentialLane` and `status` widened to `string`, on the
 * argument that `@repo/store` should not depend on `@repo/connections` for four string unions -- the
 * same argument `PerformanceQuery` makes for being a structural copy. It was wrong here, and the
 * typecheck said so: `openCredential` takes a `ConnectionRow`, a widened `string` is not one of its
 * unions, and the "structural check in the Worker" that copy was supposed to buy DID NOT EXIST.
 *
 * The copy would have had to be maintained by hand against a file nothing relates it to, which is
 * the arrangement `scripts/check-providers.mjs` exists because of. So the dependency is taken: it is
 * one `import type`, it erases at build time, and `apps/api-edge` -- the only consumer -- already
 * depends on both packages.
 *
 * `timezone` IS HERE AND NOT ON `ConnectionRow` because `ConnectionRow` is the shape the CONNECT
 * path builds and upserts, and connect has nothing to put in it: `probeStore` returns
 * `{storeUrl, totalOrders}` and the WooCommerce API may not expose the site's zone to a consumer
 * key at all. Adding it there would make every `connect` call site name a field it cannot know.
 * Moving it belongs with `scripts/seal-connection.mjs`, which is the thing that will write one.

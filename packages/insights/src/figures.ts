/**
 * THE CLOSED INPUT SET. Every number that will ever reach a customer is computed here, in
 * TypeScript, and handed to the model as a given fact.
 *
 * THE ONE RULE THIS PACKAGE HANGS ON: the model writes language, it never does arithmetic. A
 * language model asked to comment on business figures will produce figures, and one it invented
 * that looks plausible is the exact failure this product is sold against -- the same class of
 * mistake as `{row.revenue ?? 0}` printing a confident zero for a day nobody measured. So the
 * deltas, shares, rankings and impact estimates are all computed in this module, printed into the
 * prompt by `brief.ts`, and checked back out of the model's answer by `verify.ts`. A number that
 * is not in the set this module returns cannot survive the gate.
 *
 * THE THREE-BRANCH READING IS INHERITED, NOT REINVENTED. `apps/web/app/dashboard/_figures.ts`
 * already draws the value / absent / unreadable distinction for the dashboard, with a return type
 * that has no number in two of its three branches and therefore cannot be collapsed by a `??`.
 * `readMetric` below is the same decision for the same reason. It is a second copy rather than an
 * import because a package may not import an app; when the two are consolidated, that module is
 * the other half.
 *
 *   value       a number, in the row's own currency where the metric is money.
 *   absent      the platform reported nothing. NOT ZERO. Zero is a measurement.
 *   unreadable  something was stored that this code cannot read as a number. It gets its own
 *               branch because rendering it as absent hides a real defect behind an honest mark.
 *
 * AND AN ABSENT METRIC IS NAMED IN THE PROMPT RATHER THAN OMITTED FROM IT. This is the least
 * obvious decision in the file and the one most worth keeping. A metric left out of the prompt is
 * one the model infers a value for -- most often zero, stated with the same confidence as a
 * measured figure. Saying "orders: not reported for this period" costs one line and removes the
 * inference.
 *
 * UNCERTAINTY IS COMPUTED, NEVER DECORATED. The artboard promises "impact is an estimate from your
 * own numbers, shown as a range where it is uncertain", and a range is only honest if its ends are
 * arithmetic. There is no error bar, no confidence constant and no fudge factor anywhere in this
 * file. The width of a range comes from one place and one place only: the envelope's own
 * `is_provisional` flag, splitting the contributing rows into those the platform has settled and
 * those it may still restate.
 *
 *   no provisional rows       a point, from every row.
 *   some provisional rows     a RANGE, from the settled rows at one end and every row at the other.
 *                             That is the amount the platform can still move, measured rather than
 *                             assumed.
 *   all provisional rows      a point, MARKED provisional in words. There is no settled subset to
 *                             bound it with, and inventing a band around it would be the decoration
 *                             this rule exists to forbid. For a POS whose rows are provisional
 *                             forever -- `restatement.ts` already treats a merchant's own database
 *                             that way -- this is the permanent case, and the brief says so.

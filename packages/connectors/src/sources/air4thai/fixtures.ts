/**
 * Air4Thai fixtures.
 *
 * ============================================================================================
 * NOT ONE OF THESE IS A RECORDED RESPONSE, AND THE SERVICE WAS UNREACHABLE.
 * ============================================================================================
 *
 * Specification section 13.3 rule 6 requires "every fixture is a recorded real response with PII
 * scrubbed". These are not, for a different reason than `ga4/fixtures.ts`: GA4 is missing a
 * credential, while Air4Thai needs none and the response was simply never read here.
 *
 * AND NOT BECAUSE THE HOST WAS DOWN, which is what this comment used to say. `air4thai.pcd.go.th`
 * answers -- plain http returns a 301 from a live server. The https request fails at
 * `unable to get local issuer certificate`: a certificate CHAIN problem, not a connection one, and
 * a different thing to go and fix. Whether the incomplete chain belongs to the platform or to this
 * sandbox's egress could not be separated from inside it. `client.ts` carries the detail.
 *
 * So the field names and nesting below come from the DOCUMENTED shape of `getNewAQI_JSON.php` --
 * the endpoint's published form and the fields its long-standing third-party consumers read -- and
 * not from a response anybody here observed.
 *
 * EVERY ASSUMPTION IS MARKED. The ones that would change the numbers rather than merely the
 * parsing are:
 *
 *   ASSUMPTION 1  The document is `{ "stations": [ ... ] }`.
 *   ASSUMPTION 2  Each station carries `stationID` and an `AQILast` object.
 *   ASSUMPTION 3  `AQILast` carries `date` ("YYYY-MM-DD") and `time` ("HH:MM") in THAI LOCAL TIME
 *                 with no offset anywhere in the payload. This is the one that moves every
 *                 timestamp seven hours if it is wrong.
 *   ASSUMPTION 4  Pollutants are keyed `PM25`, `PM10`, `O3`, `CO`, `NO2`, `SO2`, each an object of
 *                 STRINGS with `value`, `aqi` and `color_id`.
 *   ASSUMPTION 5  `AQI` is the overall index: `aqi` plus `param` naming the driving pollutant, and
 *                 NO `value`.
 *   ASSUMPTION 6  A missing reading is the string "-1". This is the one that poisons averages if
 *                 it is wrong in the other direction -- i.e. if the real sentinel is something
 *                 else, it will parse as a measurement.
 *   ASSUMPTION 7  Units: particulates µg/m³, CO ppm, O3/NO2/SO2 ppb.
 *
 * BEFORE THIS CONNECTOR IS SCHEDULED: fetch one real response, save it here, and re-run
 * `contract.test.ts`. Where it disagrees, the recorded response is right and the normaliser is
 * wrong. Nothing below should be taken as evidence about the API; it is evidence about this code.

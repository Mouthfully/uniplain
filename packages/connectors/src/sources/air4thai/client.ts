/**
 * Air4Thai -> transport.
 *
 * THE SOURCE. Air4Thai is the Thai Pollution Control Department's public air quality service. It
 * publishes hourly readings from roughly 174 fixed monitoring stations across Thailand over an
 * UNAUTHENTICATED GET that returns every station in one JSON document.
 *
 * ============================================================================================
 * THIS CONNECTOR HOLDS NO CREDENTIAL, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE REASON IT LOOKS DIFFERENT.
 * ============================================================================================
 *
 * Compare `Ga4ClientOptions`, which carries `accessToken`, or `WooCredential`, which carries a key
 * and a secret. `Air4ThaiClientOptions` carries neither, and no field of it is secret. There is
 * nothing to seal, nothing to refresh, nothing to revoke and nothing to go stale at 3am.
 *
 * The consequences reach further than one missing field:
 *
 *   NO `connections` ROW. `public.connections` requires `credential_ciphertext`, `credential_iv`
 *   and `wrapped_dek` NOT NULL. Filing a row of placeholder bytes would put a fiction in the one
 *   table whose entire purpose is custody of real secrets.
 *
 *   NO ENTRY IN `PROVIDER_LANES`, and NO NEW MEMBER OF `app.credential_lane`. A lane answers "how
 *   did this credential get here"; there is no credential. A `none` lane would make
 *   `isSelfIssued()` -- which is `lane !== "oauth"` -- answer TRUE to "did the customer mint this
 *   itself", and `connectionHealth` would then report "Connected. This key does not expire" about
 *   something that does not exist. `scripts/check-providers.mjs` passes in both directions because
 *   nothing was added to either side; `supabase/tests/14_ambient.sql` asserts both absences so
 *   this paragraph cannot quietly stop being true.
 *
 *   NO PER-TENANT ATTRIBUTION. The rows land in `public.ambient_readings`, which is shared and
 *   carries no `workspace_id`. What a workspace owns is its SUBSCRIPTION. See the header of
 *   `supabase/migrations/20260912000900_ambient_readings.sql`.
 *
 * ============================================================================================
 * THE BASE URL AND THE RESPONSE SHAPE ARE UNVERIFIED AGAINST THE LIVE SERVICE.
 * ============================================================================================
 *
 * Stated at the top rather than buried in the fixtures, because everything below depends on it.
 * The endpoint was not READ from the environment this was written in -- but the earlier version of
 * this comment said it "never answered", and that was wrong in a way that would have sent the next
 * person to the wrong place entirely.
 *
 * WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS, re-checked rather than remembered:
 *
 *   http://air4thai.pcd.go.th/services/getNewAQI_JSON.php   ->  301, a real redirect from a live host
 *   https://  same path                                     ->  curl (60) SSL certificate problem:
 *                                                               unable to get local issuer certificate
 *
 * The host is up and serving. What fails is CHAIN VERIFICATION, and that is a different fix from an
 * unreachable host: an incomplete chain is repaired by supplying the missing intermediate, not by
 * hunting for a working hostname. "It never answered" would have had somebody looking for a dead
 * endpoint that is not dead.
 *
 * WHAT COULD NOT BE SEPARATED HERE, and is therefore not asserted: whether the incomplete chain is
 * the platform's or this sandbox's egress path. Passing the local CA bundle explicitly did not fix
 * it, which points at the server, but a proxied environment cannot settle that on its own. Check
 * from an ordinary network before treating either answer as established.
 *
 * So the URL and every field name here come from the DOCUMENTED shape -- the service's published
 * endpoint and the field names its long-standing third-party consumers read -- and not from a
 * response anyone observed. Specification section 13.3 rule 6 wants recorded fixtures with PII
 * scrubbed; these are not that, exactly as `ga4/fixtures.ts` says of its own.
 *
 * WHAT THAT MEANS IN PRACTICE: the normaliser encodes what the API is believed to return. A
 * recorded response encodes what it does return. Every assumption is marked `ASSUMPTION:` at the
 * point it is relied on, in this file, in `normalize.ts` and in `fixtures.ts`. Before this
 * connector is scheduled against the live service, fetch one response, save it as a fixture, and
 * re-run `contract.test.ts`. If it disagrees, the fixture is right and this code is wrong.
 *
 * ============================================================================================
 * WHAT THIS CLIENT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT HAVE.
 * ============================================================================================
 *
 *   NO PAGING. The endpoint returns every station in one document -- there is no cursor, no
 *   offset, no `rowCount`, and therefore no page walker and no `backfill.ts`. That absence is a
 *   fact about the service, not an omission: `check-capabilities.mjs` treats `backfill.ts` as
 *   optional precisely so a connector is not forced to assert a roadmap. A backfill here would be
 *   a different endpoint (the history service), which is a separate unit of work.
 *
 *   NO QUOTA ACCOUNTING. GA4 meters complexity tokens and Google Ads meters operations against a
 *   ceiling shared across every tenant, which is why those clients budget. This is one
 *   unauthenticated GET against a government service with no published quota; inventing a budget
 *   would produce a number that looks measured and is not (the same trap `parseMetaThrottle`
 *   documents). What it has instead is politeness: the data changes hourly, so pulling it more
 *   often than hourly spends someone else's bandwidth for nothing.

/**
 * Loyverse POS -> transport.
 *
 * The `client` half of the connector unit (specification 13.3). It builds requests, walks the
 * cursor and counts the rate budget; it does not normalise.
 *
 * THE SOURCE. Loyverse is a free point-of-sale used by small retailers and cafes. It is the pilot
 * connector for one reason, recorded in `58-plan-reconciliation.md` section 2.2: of every POS the
 * plan names, it is the only one where a Thai owner-operator can click a consent screen TODAY.
 * FoodStory answers 401 with no documentation, Ocha has no reachable API, StoreHub's docs are
 * password-gated behind "Ask WH for the password", and LINE MAN publishes nothing at all. Loyverse
 * is not the market leader. It is the one that is reachable.
 *
 * EVERY CONSTANT BELOW WAS READ OUT OF LOYVERSE'S OWN OpenAPI DOCUMENT, at
 * `https://developer.loyverse.com/docs/API-Reference__v1.0.yaml`, which its published reference
 * renders. That matters because `air4thai/client.ts` had to say the opposite about itself, and the
 * difference should be visible without diffing: no constant here is inferred from a third party's
 * SDK, and no field name here is a guess. The response SHAPES are still not recorded fixtures --
 * see `fixtures.ts` -- but the base URL, the endpoints, the query parameters, the scope names, the
 * paging mechanism, the error codes, the token lifetime and the rate limit are quoted from the
 * specification.
 *
 * ================================================================================================
 * DECISION 1. THE PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN IS REFUSED, AND THIS CLIENT IS WHERE IT IS REFUSED.
 * ================================================================================================
 *
 * Loyverse offers two authorisation methods and describes the easier one like this, verbatim:
 *
 *     "Personal access tokens are a simple way to make calls to the API."
 *     "Be aware that personal access token gives unlimited access to the targeted account."
 *
 * On this API "unlimited" is enumerable, because the same document prints the permissions table:
 * it includes `RECEIPTS_WRITE`, `ITEMS_WRITE`, `INVENTORY_WRITE`, `TAXES_WRITE`,
 * `SUPPLIERS_WRITE`, `CUSTOMERS_WRITE` and `POS_DEVICES_WRITE`. A pasted personal token can create
 * receipts and edit the merchant's inventory. It would have been the shortest connect flow in this
 * repository -- one text field, no client registration, no redirect, no refresh -- and it is
 * refused anyway.
 *
 * IT IS REFUSED IN THREE PLACES AND THAT IS DELIBERATE, because each catches a different way in:
 *
 *   * `PROVIDER_LANES.loyverse` is `["oauth"]`, so `connectWithToken` rejects the provider before
 *     anything is sealed. That stops a token arriving through the product's own connect flow.
 *   * `assertReadOnlyCredential` below refuses a `bearer` credential BY NAME, at the top of every
 *     exported entry point. That stops one arriving through a caller that built its own options
 *     object -- a backfill script, a test harness, a future ingest path.
 *   * And it refuses an `oauth` grant that reports ANY `*_WRITE` scope, because a grant wider than
 *     the two this connector asks for did not come from this product's consent screen.
 *
 * The type accepts a `bearer` credential rather than excluding it, which looks backwards and is
 * not: a union that cannot express the refused case can only refuse it at the type level, and the
 * credential arrives from a database column as data. A refusal that only exists in TypeScript is
 * not a refusal at runtime, which is where the merchant's till is.
 *
 * ================================================================================================
 * DECISION 2. THE RATE BUDGET IS COUNTED HERE, BECAUSE NOTHING REPORTS IT.
 * ================================================================================================
 *
 * "The current limit is 300 requests per 300 sec per account." Over it, `429 RATE_LIMITED`.
 *
 * GA4 reports its property quota in the response body and Meta reports usage in a header, so both
 * of those clients read a number the platform computed. Loyverse reports NOTHING -- there is no
 * `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, no quota object, no retry-after in the documented error shape. So the
 * budget is a client-side reconstruction, it is per ACCOUNT rather than per app, and it is
 * threaded through every return value instead of being module state: two connections to two
 * merchants must not share a counter, and module state is exactly how they would.
 *
 * AND A FLOOR IS HELD BACK. `LOYVERSE_RATE_FLOOR` requests are never spent by this connector. The
 * limit is per ACCOUNT, not per application -- so every request this makes is one the merchant's
 * own integrations cannot make. A cafe whose till stops syncing because our nightly pull ate the
 * account's budget has been harmed by an analytics tool, which is not a trade anyone agreed to.
 *
 * ================================================================================================
 * DECISION 3. THE WINDOW'S UPPER BOUND IS PINNED BY THE CALLER, NOT EVALUATED PER REQUEST.
 * ================================================================================================
 *
 * `updated_at_max` is required, not optional. An open-ended window re-evaluated at each request
 * SLIDES: receipts rung during the walk enter a page the walk has already passed, so they are
 * never read -- and then the watermark advances past them, because the run completed. That hole is
 * permanent and invisible, since nothing will ever ask for that window again.
 *
 * ================================================================================================
 * DECISION 4. `updated_at`, NOT `created_at`, IS WHAT THE PULL FILTERS ON.
 * ================================================================================================
 *
 * Both filters exist. `created_at_min`/`created_at_max` would be cheaper and would be wrong, for
 * the reason `RESTATEMENT_CLOCKS.loyverse` sets out: a receipt carries `updated_at` and
 * `cancelled_at`, the `receipts.update` webhook fires on update as well as creation, and a refund
 * arrives as a SECOND receipt. A created-since walk sees the new refund receipt but never re-reads
 * a sale that was voided in place, so a cancelled sale stays counted forever.
 *
 * ONE CONSEQUENCE WORTH NAMING, because it is surprising and it is the platform's: `/receipts` is
 * documented as "sorted by created_at property in descending order" regardless of which filter was
 * used. So a walk filtered on `updated_at` comes back ordered by a DIFFERENT column. Nothing here
 * depends on the order -- the cursor is the only thing that advances the walk, and the normaliser
 * keys each row by receipt number -- but a future reader tempted to infer progress from the last
 * row's timestamp should not.

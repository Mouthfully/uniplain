/**
 * @repo/payloads against a REAL R2, not a fake one.
 *
 * The package's own suite covers key construction, erasure and cost with a structural double. It
 * cannot cover the two properties the module exists for, and this file is the reason both are known:
 *
 *   1. A large payload is never materialised in a 128 MB isolate. A fake bucket that accepts a
 *      `ReadableStream` proves nothing -- it will happily accept a stream backed by a 40 MB array.
 *
 *   2. R2 REFUSES A STREAM OF UNKNOWN LENGTH. That constraint is invisible to any double, and it is
 *      what split this module into a streaming path and a buffered one. The first version of this
 *      module compressed inside the pipe and could not have worked in production.

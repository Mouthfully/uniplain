/**
 * THE RUN, END TO END, WITH NO NETWORK AND NO DATABASE.
 *
 * This is the first test in the repository that exercises all four open joints in sequence --
 * connection read, credential open, platform fetch, row write -- and it does it in real workerd
 * against fakes, because `runIngest` is a boundary over ports rather than over bindings.
 *
 * THE CREDENTIAL IS REAL. It is sealed with `@repo/vault` under a real KEK and opened by the run,
 * so the seal/open path is exercised rather than stubbed: a run that could not decrypt would fail
 * here rather than on stage.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE IS A SECRET. The KEK is generated per test, the consumer key is a fixture, and the
 * store is a function in this file.

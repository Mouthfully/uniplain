/**
 * `POST /v1/ingest/run` -- THE JOINT. The first thing in this repository that writes an envelope
 * row, and the reason every piece built before it stops being a component.
 *
 * The chain has six joints (`MVP-PLAN.md` §1) and this closes the four that were open at once: a
 * connection is read, a credential is opened, a platform is fetched, and rows are persisted. Every
 * part of it already existed and was tested; none of it had ever been called in sequence.
 *
 * A BOUNDARY OVER PORTS, WHICH IS WHY IT IS NOT IN `index.ts`. `handlePerformance` receives its
 * store and its authenticator and knows nothing about transports; this does the same, so the run
 * can be exercised end to end -- connection, credential, fetch, write -- against fakes, in real
 * workerd, with no network and no Supabase project. The route in `index.ts` is what turns bindings
 * into ports, and it is the only thing that touches `env`.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A DEDICATED SECRET, NEVER THE API KEY, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS THE WHOLE AUTHORISATION MODEL.
 *
 * `/v1/performance` authenticates a customer's `mp_live_…` key and resolves it to one workspace.
 * That key is READ-ONLY by construction: the token minted from it carries no `sub`, so
 * `app.can_write_workspace()` refuses, and a stolen key cannot re-point a connection or invite a
 * member. If this route accepted the same key, holding one would mean being able to spend the
 * merchant's own store's capacity -- and to cause writes into `envelope_rows` -- which is a
 * strictly larger power than reading numbers back.
 *
 * So it takes `INGEST_TOKEN`, an operator secret, and the workspace arrives in the BODY rather than
 * from the credential. That inverts `performance.ts`'s rule ("accepting the workspace from the
 * caller would make cross-tenant access a matter of typing a different id") and it is sound here
 * for a reason that does not generalise: the holder of this secret is the operator, who already has
 * every workspace. The isolation that still applies is the one that cannot be typed around -- the
 * connection read runs under a token claiming exactly the workspace in the body, so a mismatched
 * (workspace, connection) pair is refused BY ROW-LEVEL SECURITY, not by this file.
 *
 * MANUAL, NOT A CRON, per `MVP-PLAN.md` Decision 2. A cron cannot be demonstrated on stage: you
 * would be waiting on a minute boundary and hoping. The cron is a later `scheduled` handler calling
 * exactly this function.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * COUNTS AND REASONS ONLY, in the response and in the log. Same rule as `ScheduledOutcome`'s, and
 * here it has teeth: the objects in scope during a run include a decrypted consumer secret and a
 * page of orders carrying buyer name, email, phone and address. Neither may reach a response body,
 * a log line, or an error message. `runReport` below is the only shape that leaves, and it holds
 * numbers, a connection id the caller already typed, and error text this repository wrote.
 *
 * THE WATERMARK IS RETURNED, NOT PERSISTED, and that is a limitation with a cause rather than an
 * oversight. `connections_update` is `using (app.can_write_workspace(workspace_id))`, which refuses
 * outright when `app.current_user_id()` is null -- and the token minted here deliberately has no
 * `sub`, because a fabricated human identity is what would turn this into a credential that can
 * re-point a connection. So the Worker physically cannot write `last_backfill_at`. Storing run
 * state needs a `security definer` advance function or a human session; until then the operator
 * holds the watermark, which is the honest shape for a manually triggered run.

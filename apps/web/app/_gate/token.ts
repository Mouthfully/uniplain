/**
 * THE ACCESS GATE'S TOKEN.
 *
 * The site is password protected. A shared password unlocks it; everyone else is sent to /access.
 *
 * THE PASSWORD IS NEVER PUT IN A COOKIE. What is stored is an HMAC of a fixed label under the
 * password as key -- one-way, so a stolen cookie does not yield the password, and deterministic, so
 * no session store is needed to recognise a returning visitor. Changing the password invalidates
 * every existing cookie by construction, which is what a shared password needs when it leaks.
 *
 * THIS IS A CURTAIN, NOT A VAULT, and saying so is the point. It keeps an unfinished product off
 * the open web and out of search results. It is one shared secret with no per-person identity, so
 * it is not an access control for anything that matters -- the signed-in routes have their own,
 * through Supabase Auth and row-level security, and none of that is replaced by this.
 */

/**
 * The domain separation label, and deliberately NOT the product name.
 *
 * It is baked into every cookie this gate ever issues, so a rename would invalidate all of them at
 * once. `packages/vault/src/vault.ts` took the same decision for the same reason and says it best:
 * a name in here "would be a latent data migration disguised as a string literal". The brand guard
 * enforces it independently, and caught this line when it did name the product.

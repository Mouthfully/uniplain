/**
 * THE SITEMAP.
 *
 * Only pages that are meant to be FOUND. `/signin` and `/dashboard` both carry `robots: noindex` in
 * their own metadata, and listing a noindexed URL here is a contradiction a crawler resolves by
 * distrusting the file: a sitemap is an assertion that a URL is canonical and worth indexing, so it
 * must agree with the page's own directive. They are absent for that reason, not by oversight.
 *
 * `siteUrl()` resolves the base rather than a literal, for the reason `layout.tsx` records -- a
 * preview deployment must advertise itself and not production. A sitemap generated on a preview
 * therefore describes the preview, which is correct: nothing should ever submit one to a search
 * engine from a branch build.
 *
 * `lastModified` is the build time. It is honest at the granularity anyone uses it: this is a
 * static export, so every page genuinely was generated at this moment. Faking per-page dates from
 * git history would be more precise and no more true, since a shared component changing alters a
 * page its own file's history does not mention.

/**
 * THE PRICING PAGE, at /pricing.
 *
 * IT IS THE LONG FORM OF `app/_sections/Pricing.tsx`, NOT A SECOND OPINION ON PRICE. The four
 * self-serve tiers, their summaries and their feature lists are that section's, and the numbers are
 * not re-typed here at all: `PLAN_DISPLAY` in `app/_billing/plans.ts` is the catalogue the checkout
 * reads. A price typed into a marketing page is a price that can disagree with the one charged.
 *
 * NOTHING VALIDATES THESE AGAINST STRIPE. `plans.test.ts` checks the annual arithmetic and
 * `stripe-prices.test.ts` checks what the creation script would send, but neither calls Stripe.
 *
 * THE YEARLY FIGURES ARE RENDERED HERE, AND THE HOMEPAGE SECTION'S REASON FOR NOT RENDERING THEM
 * NO LONGER APPLIES. That section's module comment says the yearly amounts "do not exist anywhere
 * in the design", which was true of the design and is no longer true of the repository: `yearly` is
 * a written-out field on every entry in `PLAN_DISPLAY`, checked against twenty per cent off twelve
 * months by its own test. So this page prints both figures as static text and needs no toggle, no
 * client component and no state -- the thing the toggle existed to reveal is simply on the page.
 *
 * THE FIFTH TIER HAS NO PRICE AND MAKES NO NEW PROMISE. What separates Enterprise is said in this
 * product's own nouns -- connectors, workspaces under one organisation, switching between them from
 * one login, an invoice rather than a card, a named person -- and the panel then says out loud what
 * it does NOT carry. There is no certification, no audit report, no availability guarantee and no
 * dedicated instance behind it, because none of those exists; `packages/brand/src/claims.ts`
 * withholds the gdpr, dpa and data-region claims for the same reason and this page does not route
 * around that list.
 *
 * WHERE A LIMIT HAS NOT BEEN DECIDED, THE TABLE SAYS SO. Nothing in the schema or in the plan
 * catalogue caps workspaces or members per plan, so those cells read "Not set" rather than carrying
 * a number somebody would plan around. Same rule as the connector pages: an absence is stated, not
 * filled. The open terms at the foot of the page are the same decision applied to the contract.
 *
 * WHAT THE MATRIX MAY CLAIM, AND WHAT WAS TAKEN OUT OF IT.
 *
 * Every per-plan cell now comes from `PLAN_ENTITLEMENTS` in `app/_billing/entitlements.ts`, so this
 * page cannot say a plan allows something the product's own record does not. That record publishes
 * three fields, which is why the Connections group is short and the Reporting and Support groups
 * are gone entirely.
 *
 * Deleted rather than reworded: the per-plan refresh cadence (Daily / Hourly / 15 min / 5 min),
 * custom reports, AI insight tiers, task management, team collaboration, white-label reports, API
 * access, support channel and custom onboarding. No migration has a cadence column, and no
 * migration gates any feature on a subscription -- `public.current_plan` is read by the billing
 * screen to display a name and by nothing that does work. Each of those rows told a buyer that
 * paying more switches something on, and nothing switches. A softened version of an unbacked row is
 * still unbacked and is harder to find on the next pass, so they are off the page.
 *
 * "Connectors" became "Connected accounts" for a different reason, and the number survived because
 * of it. Five connectors exist (`packages/connectors/src/sources`), so "200+ connectors" advertised
 * a library that is not there. How many ACCOUNTS a plan lets you connect is a term of sale like the
 * price beside it, and that is what the row now says.
 *
 * THE BILLING ANSWERS ARE READ OUT OF THE CODE, not out of habit. `public.current_plan` in
 * `supabase/migrations/20260912000600_billing.sql` entitles a cancelled subscription until
 * `current_period_end` passes, counts `past_due` as still entitled and `unpaid` as not, and those
 * three facts are what the FAQ says in words.
 *
 * EVERY SENTENCE ABOUT CREDENTIALS, TENANCY AND ROWS COMES THROUGH `claim()`, so it cannot say
 * anything `CLAIMS` has not already approved with a specification citation behind it.

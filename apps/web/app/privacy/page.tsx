/**
 * THE PRIVACY POLICY, at /privacy.
 *
 * IT HOLDS TO THE SAME RULE AS `terms/page.tsx`, AND FOR THE SAME REASON. A privacy policy is not
 * marketing that can be softened in the next sprint: it is a written representation a customer's
 * counsel reads, relies on and quotes back, and in several jurisdictions a false statement in one
 * is actionable on its own. So EVERY STATEMENT HERE IS EITHER READ OUT OF THE REPOSITORY OR
 * DECLARED ABSENT.
 *
 * What is read, and from where:
 *
 *   the controller       `brand.legalEntity`, `formatAddress()`, `brand.companyRegistration`,
 *                        `brand.postalAddress.country` and `brand.supportEmail` -- the same five
 *                        values the imprint in `_chrome.tsx` and the parties panel in `terms`
 *                        render, because three documents disagreeing about who the company is
 *                        would be the worst possible drift.
 *   account data         `apps/web/app/_auth/actions.ts` and `auth/callback/route.ts` (a sign-in
 *                        link or Google, never a password held here), `_work-email.ts` (the
 *                        company-address rule), `supabase/migrations/20260908000400_invitations.sql`
 *                        (an invitation is an address and a role) and `20260912000700_waitlist.sql`
 *                        (an address and where the form was submitted from).
 *   the session          `apps/web/middleware.ts`: `getUser()` verifies the token with the auth
 *                        server on every request rather than trusting the cookie.
 *   credentials          `packages/vault/src/vault.ts`: a fresh 256-bit key per connection per
 *                        rotation, the credential sealed under it with AES-256-GCM, that key
 *                        sealed under a key encryption key held outside the database, both seals
 *                        bound to the workspace and connection as additional authenticated data.
 *                        Read-only access and revocation at the platform are the `read-only-oauth`
 *                        claim in `packages/brand/src/claims.ts`, which `allowedClaims()` permits.
 *   platform data        the `tenant-isolation`, `no-pooling` and `no-training` claims, all three
 *                        ALLOWED; `packages/connectors/src/sources/woocommerce/normalize.ts`, whose
 *                        `rows.push` carries identifiers, money, dates and a timezone and no buyer
 *                        name, email, phone or address at all; and
 *                        `packages/payloads/src/redaction.ts`, whose WooCommerce policy is an
 *                        allow-list -- an unrecognised field is dropped rather than stored.
 *   hosting region       `brand.dataRegion`, which is set. The sentence is COMPUTED from it.
 *   cookies              `apps/web/app/_gate/token.ts` (the pre-launch cookie is an HMAC of a fixed
 *                        label, carrying no identity) and `_auth/server.ts` (the session cookies).
 *                        `layout.tsx` loads no third-party script and `globals.css` fetches no
 *                        remote font, so the no-tracking sentence is a property of the tree.
 *   payments             `apps/web/app/_billing/actions.ts`: checkout and the billing portal are
 *                        hosted by the payment processor and the customer is redirected to them, so
 *                        no card detail ever reaches this application.
 *
 * WHAT IS DECLARED ABSENT, AND WHY THAT IS THE ONLY HONEST ANSWER. Six things a reader of a policy
 * like this one expects to find require a decision or an arrangement that does not exist:
 * a data processing agreement (`brand.dpaAvailable` is false), a representative in the Union
 * (`brand.euRepresentative` is null), a published sub-processor list, a transfer mechanism, a
 * retention schedule, and a notice period for changes to this document. `claims.ts` withholds the
 * `gdpr`, `dpa` and `data-region` claims on exactly those grounds. Each is therefore rendered as a
 * clause carrying the `Not yet published` marker and restated in OPEN_ITEMS at the foot.
 *
 * A plausible default would have been easy and is exactly the failure mode. "We rely on standard
 * contractual clauses" and "logs are kept for 12 months" read as decisions, would be relied upon as
 * decisions, and are not ones. An admitted gap can be closed; a fabricated assurance has to be
 * retracted, and by then somebody has already relied on it.
 *
 * NO CERTIFICATION, AUDIT, ATTESTATION OR COMPLIANCE CLAIM APPEARS ANYWHERE ON THIS PAGE. The
 * company is pre-launch and holds none of them.
 *
 * THE LAST-UPDATED DATE IS A CONSTANT, not `new Date()`. A legal document that reports today's date
 * on every render tells a reader it changed this morning and destroys the only signal a version
 * date carries. It is set by hand, here, when the text changes.

/**
 * THE PRICING SECTION -- the reference's `<section id="pricing" class="section container pricing">`,
 * headed "Simple, transparent pricing." The header and footer nav both link to `/#pricing`, so the
 * id is load-bearing rather than decorative: without it three links in the chrome scroll nowhere.
 *
 * THE BILLING TOGGLE IS A DISPLAY, NOT A CONTROL -- read this before "fixing" it.
 * The reference ships two <button>s and a script that rewrites each price when you switch. That
 * script is not in the supplied page set (only index.html, styles.css, extended.css and the brand
 * guide were delivered), so the yearly figures do not exist anywhere in the design. The brief's
 * rule is that pricing is taken verbatim and never invented, and a yearly figure for $19 is a
 * number I would be making up, not reading. So this section renders MONTHLY ONLY and the pill is a
 * static segmented indicator: two spans, no <button>, no href, no hover state, no pointer cursor,
 * nothing focusable. It states which period the prices below are quoted in and that a yearly term
 * costs ten months rather than twelve -- both true -- and the `.billing-note` underneath repeats
 * the period in words. A dead
 * <button> that swallows a click would be the misleading version; this is the honest one. When the
 * yearly figures arrive, this becomes a "use client" component with useState over a second price
 * field, and nothing else about the file changes.
 *
 * THE "MOST POPULAR" CARD is marked with the accent border plus a 3px halo in the pale-blue inset
 * token, which is the reference's own treatment (a tinted border and a barely-there ring) expressed
 * in the two tokens that already carry those roles. Tailwind splits a shadow into geometry and
 * colour, so `shadow-[0_0_0_3px]` sets the ring and `shadow-surface-inset` fills it -- which means
 * the halo follows the palette into dark mode instead of being frozen at a light-mode value.
 *
 * COMPARISON TABLE. The reference puts one inside this same section, so it is here. It is the one
 * element allowed to be wider than the body, inside its own horizontal scroller, per the brief's
 * responsive rule.
 *
 * WHAT THE CARDS AND THE TABLE MAY SAY, AND WHY THERE IS SO LITTLE OF IT.
 *
 * The reference's per-tier bullet lists sold a refresh cadence (Daily / Hourly / 15 min / 5 min),
 * custom reports, AI insights, task management, team collaboration, white-label reports, API access
 * and a support tier. None of those is gated on a plan anywhere in this repository -- no migration
 * has a cadence column and none gates a feature on a subscription -- so every one of them was a
 * promise the product could not keep, and they are deleted rather than reworded. A vaguer version
 * of an unbacked claim is still unbacked and is harder to find later.
 *
 * WHAT SURVIVES IS THE CONNECTION ALLOWANCE, AND IT IS NO LONGER TYPED HERE. `PLAN_ENTITLEMENTS`
 * in `app/_billing/entitlements.ts` holds the four figures once; `connectionAllowance` in
 * `app/_content.ts` turns one into the phrase a card prints. So this section and `/pricing` cannot
 * disagree with each other or with the catalogue, and the word is "connected accounts" rather than
 * "connectors" -- five connectors exist, and "200+ connectors" claimed a library, not a limit.

/**
 * THE FAQ AND THE CLOSING PANEL -- the reference's `<section id="faq" class="section container
 * split faq">` and the `<section class="container final-cta">` directly beneath it. They ship in
 * one file because they are one closing movement in the design: the FAQ's bottom padding and the
 * panel's top margin are a single 20px seam in the stylesheet, and splitting them across two files
 * would put the two halves of that seam out of each other's sight.
 *
 * THE ACCORDION IS NATIVE, AND THAT IS THE POINT. `<details>`/`<summary>` already own everything a
 * hand-rolled accordion has to re-implement badly: keyboard operation, the expanded/collapsed state
 * announced to assistive tech, in-page find that opens the panel holding the match, and correct
 * behaviour before hydration. So this file ships no client boundary -- it stays a server component,
 * and the whole section costs zero JavaScript.
 *
 * THE +/- AFFORDANCE IS TWO ELEMENTS, NOT A SWAPPED `content`. The reference draws it with
 * `summary:after{content:'+'}` and `details[open] summary:after{content:'−'}`. Reproducing that
 * literally would mean a Tailwind arbitrary `content-['...']` carrying a non-ASCII glyph inside a
 * class name, which is a fragile thing to make a visual state depend on. Instead both glyphs are
 * real spans and `group-open:` shows one and hides the other -- still pure CSS, still no script,
 * but the glyphs live in the markup where they can be read. The pair is `aria-hidden` because the
 * disclosure state is already in the accessibility tree: a screen reader saying "plus" after the
 * question it just announced as collapsed is noise, not information.
 *
 * THE MARKER IS KILLED TWICE. `list-none` handles the standards-track triangle; the
 * `::-webkit-details-marker` rule handles older WebKit, which ignores it. Both are needed, and the
 * reference sets `list-style:none` for the same reason.
 *
 * THE CLOSING PANEL'S GRADIENT HAS NO TOKEN. The reference fills it with a two-stop pale blue to
 * pale mint wash. The token file defines the two brand gradients it needs (display text and the
 * hero glow) and no third one, so the panel takes the flat pale-blue inset surface instead -- the
 * token whose documented role is exactly this, a soft feature background. Writing the gradient's
 * two stops here would create a second source of truth for colour, which the tokens guard refuses
 * outright. See the report note.
 *
 * THE PANEL IS TWO ELEMENTS, NOT ONE. In the reference a single element is both the 1200px
 * container and the padded panel, so its 32px gutter and its 48px padding are set on the same box.
 * Split here: the outer <section> carries the width and the gutter, the inner <div> the fill,
 * radius and padding. Collapsed into one box the panel would run to the screen edges on any
 * viewport under 1200px, because the gutter would be inside the fill rather than outside it.

/**
 * Section copy, rewritten for the new positioning.
 *
 * THE OLD FAQ ANSWERED A DASHBOARD BUYER. "What platforms does it support?", "Do I need technical
 * skills?" -- the questions of someone deciding between reporting tools. The page no longer sells a
 * reporting tool, so the questions an owner-operator actually has are the ones asked here: what
 * lands, where the numbers came from, whether anything gets changed on their behalf, and what it
 * costs.
 *
 * AND THE TRAP THIS FILE ALREADY WALKED INTO ONCE, which is why it is written down twice. The old
 * "Can I try it for free?" answer restated three claims -- "three connectors, daily refresh and
 * standard reports" -- that the pricing block one section above had just dropped. The FAQ is where
 * a reader goes precisely when the card did not answer them, so a claim withheld above and
 * restated here is a claim republished. Three consequences bind every answer below:
 *
 *   * No answer names a source. `docs/marketplane/58-plan-reconciliation.md` section 5.1 stops the
 *     Thai POS vendors, the delivery platforms and the banks appearing as sources anywhere on this
 *     site, and the old first answer listed an integration library by category. Gone, not moved.
 *   * No answer counts anything. `check-claim-sources.mjs` bans a source or integration count, and
 *     the reconciliation notes "200+" once evaded the pattern by putting the `+` where the regex
 *     expected whitespace. The guard is not the reason not to write a count.
 *   * Read-only is worded as WHAT WE ASK FOR AND ENFORCE, never as a guarantee the platforms make.
 *     Section 5.1 is explicit: it is true of Loyverse and Xero, and on QuickBooks, FlowAccount,
 *     Grab, foodpanda and StoreHub one token covers read and write, so the promise there is our
 *     code and not their scope.
 *
 * The eyebrow is stored in sentence case because the capitals are CSS, not content.

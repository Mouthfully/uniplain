/**
 * THE INTEGRATIONS SPLIT -- the section the header's "Integrations" link points at.
 *
 * `_content.ts` links the nav to `/#integrations`, so the id here is load-bearing rather than
 * decorative: without it that nav item scrolls nowhere.
 *
 * THE MAP IS MARKUP, NOT A PICTURE. The design draws eight connector tiles wired into a central
 * mark, and the obvious shortcut is to export that arrangement as one image. It is the wrong
 * shortcut: the tiles carry the platform NAMES, which a screen reader has to be able to read and
 * which change whenever the connector list changes, and an image of a connector list goes stale
 * silently because nothing can fail a build over it. Every mark is the real supplied artwork from
 * `apps/web/public/platforms/`, placed with the same `<img>` decision `IntegrationsStrip.tsx`
 * records, and the centre is the brand mark from `@repo/brand` rather than a typed path.
 *
 * THE `<img alt="">` IS EMPTY ON PURPOSE, in the tiles and in the centre. The platform name sits
 * next to its mark as live text, so alt text would make a screen reader announce every platform
 * twice. The artwork is decorative in the accessibility sense even though it is the point visually.
 *
 * THE DISCLOSURE IS NATIVE `<details>`, SO THIS STAYS A SERVER COMPONENT. A chevron that rotates
 * and a list that expands is exactly what the element does on its own; reaching for `useState`
 * here would ship a client bundle to animate a triangle, and would break the list for anyone who
 * loads the page before hydration -- including a crawler reading the connector names.
 *
 * WHERE THE REFERENCE'S SEPARATE "EXPLORE ALL INTEGRATIONS" LINK WENT. The design puts a text link
 * and this disclosure in the same column, the link pointing at a connectors page that does not
 * exist in this app. A link to nowhere is worse than one control, and the stylesheet gives the
 * `<summary>` the same blue-bold treatment as that link, so the two are merged: the summary IS the
 * control. It gets a real destination back the day a connectors route exists.
 *
 * TWO GRADIENTS, BOTH BUILT FROM TOKENS. The map's radial wash and the connecting rules are
 * gradients, which have no flat colour utility -- but Tailwind's gradient utilities take the same
 * token-mapped colours as everything else, so `bg-radial from-surface-inset to-surface` and
 * `bg-linear-to-r from-brand-blue to-brand-mint` need no literal and follow a palette change. See
 * the report for the two hues this approximates.
 *
 * NO SHADOWS. The reference lifts every tile a few pixels off the page. The only shadow the token
 * file defines is `--mp-shadow-lift`, reserved there for the hero demo ("do not blanket-shadow
 * cards; that flattens the hierarchy"), so the tiles are hairline-bordered like the feature cards
 * the rest of the page already renders.

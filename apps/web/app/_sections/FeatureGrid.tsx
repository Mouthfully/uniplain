/**
 * THE CAPABILITY GRID -- the reference's `<section class="section container">` that used to be
 * headed "From insights to impact.", keeping its geometry and taking a new job. See the second
 * block below for why the copy moved.
 *
 * WHAT THE REFERENCE PUTS HERE, AND WHY THIS IS A CARD GRID INSTEAD. In the supplied page this
 * section is a split: a mocked assistant panel on the left, and on the right the eyebrow, heading,
 * lead and a four-item tick list. This file keeps that ARRANGEMENT and promotes the tick
 * list into the 2x2 `.feature-card` grid the section was briefed as -- same card geometry as the
 * grid one section up (24px padding, 16px radius, hairline border, one soft shadow), so the two
 * sections read as one family rather than as two unrelated treatments.
 *
 * THE GRID SITS ON THE LEFT AT DESKTOP, which is the reference's alternation: the section above
 * leads with copy, this one leads with the visual. The copy block is nevertheless FIRST IN THE
 * DOM and moved with `order`, so the h2 is announced before the four h3s beneath it and the mobile
 * stack reads heading-then-cards. Reproducing the reference's DOM order instead would put four
 * subheadings ahead of the heading they belong to.
 *
 * COLOUR. The reference tints each icon with a one-off hue (its c0/c1/c2/c3 classes) -- values
 * that are not in the token set, though three of them sit within a few percent of tokens that are.
 * Each card therefore names a token role: brand mint and brand blue for the two that map almost
 * exactly, the action accent for the rest. c0's violet has no counterpart anywhere in the brand
 * guide and is NOT reproduced -- inventing a fifth brand hue to match one icon would put a colour
 * outside the token file, which is the thing the guard exists to prevent.
 *
 * THE CARD SHADOW keeps the reference's geometry (0 7px 24px) but takes its colour from
 * `shadow-line-soft` rather than from the reference's fixed slate wash. Tailwind splits those two
 * halves -- the arbitrary value carries offset and blur, the colour utility fills
 * `--tw-shadow-color` -- so the soft-hairline token tints it and the shadow follows the palette
 * into dark mode instead of staying a light-mode value forever.

/**
 * WHAT THIS SECTION IS NOW, AND WHY IT HAD TO CHANGE.
 *
 * It used to render the eyebrow, heading and lead of `AssistantPanel.tsx` BYTE FOR BYTE -- same
 * "Your AI-powered analyst", same "From insights / to impact.", same lead.
 * `docs/marketplane/58-plan-reconciliation.md` section 5.1 lists that duplication as copy that
 * must stop: "one of them is redundant on any positioning". Rather than delete a section the
 * design needs, this one takes the job the page was missing -- naming the four capabilities the
 * founder's plan is made of -- and the assistant panel keeps the engine.
 *
 * EVERY CARD ENDS IN A DECISION, NOT A VISUALISATION. That is the whole repositioning: the site
 * sold a dashboard, the plan sells being told what to do. So no card body describes a chart, a
 * view or a report you read; each says what arrives and what you do about it.
 */

/**
 * Section copy. `scripts/check-copy.mjs` refuses a sentence typed into the JSX, so every line
 * arrives from here. The eyebrow is stored in sentence case because the capitals are CSS.
 */
// "WHAT ARRIVES, AND WHEN" ANSWERS A QUESTION THE PRODUCT CANNOT ANSWER. Nothing arrives: a brief
// is written when somebody asks for one. The eyebrow now describes what the section is actually
// about, which is what each of the four things ends in.
const EYEBROW = "What you get, and what it is for";

/** The heading's line break is the design's, so its two lines are two values. */
const HEADING_TOP = "Four things that end";
const HEADING_BOTTOM = "in a decision.";

// THE FIFTH PLACE THE UNBUILT CADENCE WAS WRITTEN DOWN, and the one a scan found rather than a
// reader: "Yesterday in three lines at breakfast, a ranked list on Monday ... the report your
// accountant wants on the first." Three separate schedules in one sentence, none of which exists.
// Nothing runs on a clock, and note 65 already recorded that two of the four things named here --
// the ranked sheet and the accountant's report -- are not expressible in the current dictionary at
// all. What survives is the shape of each, which is what the four cards below actually show.
const LEAD =
  "None of them hands you a chart to interpret. The week in three lines, a ranked list of what to do, a plain answer whenever you ask, and the numbers your accountant wants in the form they want them.";

/**
 * The four capabilities, in the order the founder's plan lists them and the order an owner meets
 * them: the brief arrives before the sheet, the sheet before the question, the question before the
 * month-end report.
 *
 * `title` and `body` are the plan's own descriptions of each capability, compressed. THREE OF THE
 * FOUR DO NOT EXIST YET -- there is no brief generator, no action sheet and no Ask in `apps/` or
 * `packages/` -- which is why the accompanying design note records each of these four bodies as a
 * claim written ahead of its capability rather than leaving them to be discovered later.
 *
 * WHAT WAS CUT, AND THE LINE IT WAS CUT ON. Being unbuilt is not by itself a reason to delete a
 * line: a roadmap item is a promise with a path. Three clauses here had no path -- a language
 * nothing is localised to, a comparison nothing performs, and two report names the data dictionary
 * cannot express -- and each is annotated below at the line it left.
 *
 * `path` is a 24-box outline mark on the same 1.7 stroke as the reference's icon set, and
 * deliberately not one of the four marks the section above already spends: repeating those here
 * would make two adjacent grids look like the same grid twice.

/**
 * CONSOLIDATED REPORTS -- the fourth capability, in the section that used to sell templates.
 *
 * WHY IT IS NOT A TEMPLATES SECTION ANY MORE. `docs/marketplane/58-plan-reconciliation.md` section
 * 5.1 lists `Templates` under copy that must stop, with the reason in one line: "the plan's owner
 * does not build reports from templates; the product decides for them". An owner-operator with no
 * analyst does not want a gallery to choose from -- choosing is the work they do not have time
 * for. The section was re-aimed rather than deleted, because the founder's plan has a fourth
 * capability (consolidated reports) with nowhere else to live, and it is exactly a four-up of
 * named, finished documents.
 *
 * THE FOUR WERE THE PLAN'S OWN LIST and two of them are no longer on it: monthly investor update,
 * **P&L by unit and channel**, **bank loan pack**, accountant export. Not a category each -- a
 * document each, with a name the person who asked for it would use.
 *
 * WHY TWO WERE REPLACED RATHER THAN LEFT AS A ROADMAP LINE. `docs/marketplane/60` groups the
 * unbacked copy by what is missing, and these two sit in the group it calls worse than unbuilt:
 * the contract has no shape for them, so no amount of building delivers them without a dictionary
 * change first.
 *
 *   * "P&L by unit and channel" is blocked twice. `dimensionsSchema` carries date, currency,
 *     timezone and attribution_window -- there is no `unit`. And a P&L needs costs:
 *     `packages/contract/src/metrics.ts` has `spend`, `fees` and `commission`, and nothing that
 *     is a cost of goods or an operating expense. A profit-and-loss statement cannot be computed
 *     from a dictionary with no cost side.
 *
 *   * "Bank loan pack" has no bank. `packages/connectors/src/sources` holds air4thai, ga4,
 *     google_ads, meta_ads, search_console and woocommerce. Note 60 section 1.3 records Thai
 *     deposit data as regulator-blocked until roughly 2027, so this is not a connector somebody
 *     writes next quarter.
 *
 * The two replacements are named for what the envelope can actually express today: `source` IS the
 * channel, and revenue, orders, net_revenue, fees and spend are all in the dictionary. None of the
 * four is GENERATED yet -- that is a real gap and note 60 section 6.2 records it -- but a report
 * that has not been written is a roadmap item, and a report the data model cannot express is a
 * promise with nothing behind it.
 *
 * THE CARDS ARE LINKS, NOT BUTTONS. The reference ships each card as `<button data-template="...">`,
 * wired by its own script to open the page's `<dialog id="demo">` with a preview. Neither that
 * script nor a per-report route exists in this app, so a literal transcription would ship four
 * buttons that swallow a click. Each card is an `<a>` to `/dashboard` instead -- a route that
 * exists -- which is the treatment `UseCases.tsx` already settled on for the same `data-template`
 * markup. This stays a server component as a result: nothing here holds state.
 *
 * THE BARS. Heights and per-bar opacities are the reference's own inline styles, transcribed value
 * for value (35/51/42/67/57/85/75/96 on the first card, and so on), because the stagger is the
 * design -- a flat or evenly-ascending set reads as a placeholder. They are inline `style` because
 * they are data that varies per bar, not a design decision: eight Tailwind height classes per card
 * would put the same numbers in the markup with more ceremony. No colour is written there, and the
 * chart's accessible name says "sample" for the reason section 5.3 gives.
 *
 * COLOUR AND RADII, WITH TWO SUBSTITUTIONS, BOTH REPORTED:
 *   * The bar fill is a two-stop vertical gradient in the reference. Its first stop IS the value
 *     of `--mp-brand-blue`; the second has no token, and is that same blue at roughly 40% over
 *     white,
 *     so the gradient is `from-brand-blue to-brand-blue/40` -- no literal, and it follows a palette
 *     change instead of freezing today's one.
 *   * The reference's panel ground and card border are each a percent or two from
 *     `--mp-surface-subtle` and `--mp-line`, which already carry exactly those roles.
 * The panel's 22px radius takes `rounded-xl` (24px, the guide's feature-panel step) and the cards'
 * 12px takes `rounded-lg` (16px, the guide's card step): the guide assigns radii by ROLE, so
 * matching the role beats shaving 2px off the nearest number. The 2px bar caps are the one
 * arbitrary length left inline -- the smallest radius token is 6px, which on a 7px-wide bar reads
 * as a lozenge rather than a bar.
 *
 * The reference gives the cards a hover shadow; the only shadow token is reserved for the hero, so
 * hover moves the border instead, as the other sections do.

 * and the accompanying design note records all four as claims written ahead of the capability. The
 * difference the header draws still holds: all four are unbuilt, and all four are now expressible.

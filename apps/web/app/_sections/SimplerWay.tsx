/**
 * THE FIRST SPLIT -- the product section the header's "Product" link points at.
 *
 * The nav in `_content.ts` links to `/#product`, and the supplied page set puts that id on exactly
 * this section, so the id is load-bearing rather than decorative: without it the first nav item
 * scrolls nowhere.
 *
 * THE GRID IS THE DESIGN'S `.split`, NOT A GENERIC TWO-UP. The reference sets `1fr 1fr` with an
 * 80px gap and `align-items:center`, narrows the gap to 40px once the columns get cramped, and
 * collapses to a single column below 760px -- which is the brand guide's own "collapse multi-column
 * content ... typically below 768px". Those three steps are reproduced here as base / md / lg
 * rather than flattened into one breakpoint, because at the middle width two 1fr columns still fit
 * and only the gutter has to give.
 *
 * THE CARDS ARE BORDER-ONLY ON PURPOSE. The reference gives each card a soft drop shadow, but the
 * only shadow the token file defines is `--mp-shadow-lift`, which it reserves for the hero demo
 * ("do not blanket-shadow cards; that flattens the hierarchy"). Inventing a second shadow would
 * mean writing a colour literal, which the tokens guard refuses and which would create a second
 * source of truth for elevation. A hairline reads the same at this size and matches the feature
 * cards the rest of the page already renders.
 *
 * THE ICON HUES ARE THE TOKENS, NOT THE REFERENCE'S FOUR. The stylesheet tints the four marks
 * purple, mint, bright blue and blue. Three of those map onto existing tokens; the purple has no
 * token anywhere in the system, so the first mark takes the action accent instead of introducing a
 * hue the palette has never had. See the report note.

/**
 * Section copy, re-aimed from "see your data" to "get told what to do".
 *
 * The section used to be headed "A simpler way to work with your data." and its four cards were
 * Connect / Unify / Analyze / Share -- a description of a pipeline, which is what
 * `docs/marketplane/58-plan-reconciliation.md` section 5.1 calls plumbing: "unification is
 * plumbing" and every BI tool sells it. The four steps now end where the product ends, in a
 * decision and then in a check that the decision worked.
 *
 * Every sentence lives here because `scripts/check-copy.mjs` refuses one typed into the JSX, and
 * the uppercase eyebrow is set as sentence case because the capitals are CSS.

 * The lead opens on the product name, which may not be typed as a literal anywhere outside the
 * brand package -- `scripts/check-brand.mjs` enforces that. So it is read from `@repo/brand` and
 * only its first letter is derived here: the brand file holds the name as a lowercase identifier,
 * while the brand guide requires the capital at the front of a sentence.

/**
 * The four steps, in the order an owner meets them. `path` is the outline mark's single `d`; the
 * marks are 24px-grid outlines on a 1.75 stroke, per the brand guide's "Shape and interface
 * details", and they are the reference's own four in the reference's own order.
 *
 * STEP FOUR USED TO BE "Check" -- "Next week it says whether it worked, in your own numbers" -- on
 * the argument that a recommendation nobody ever checks is indistinguishable from a guess. The
 * argument is right and the capability does not exist: nothing in `apps/` or `packages/` compares a
 * recommendation against what happened afterwards, and it is not a cron away. It needs a record of
 * what was recommended, a record of what the owner did about it, and a measurement of the period
 * after -- two tables and a job, none of which is written.
 *
 * So the step now carries the property that IS true at the end of the sequence, and is the reason
 * the whole product exists: every figure names its source and the moment it was read, and says so
 * while it may still change. `fetched_at` and `is_provisional` are envelope columns that
 * `/dashboard` renders today. The follow-up check belongs in this section when it is built; a step
 * that describes it before then is the guess it warns against.
 *
 * STEP TWO went the same way. It read "It works out what kind of business you run from the data",
 * and nothing infers a business type: `leadingMetrics(business)` in
 * `packages/insights/src/figures.ts` takes the type as an INPUT. The per-trade emphasis is real
 * code; the inference is not, so the step now says who supplies it.

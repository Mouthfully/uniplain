/**
 * THE GOOGLE ADS FIELD CATALOGUE -- the supplied `google-ads-fields.html`, at /fields/google-ads.
 *
 * THE PAGE IS THE SAME THREE-COLUMN DOC SHELL AS /docs: topline rule, sticky section index, the
 * article, sticky "on this page" rail. Both rails drop where the reference drops them (right rail
 * below 1280px, left rail below 768px). The rail data is re-declared here rather than imported
 * because `apps/web/app/docs/page.tsx` belongs to another agent this pass and exports only its
 * page; the day a shared `_docs-shell` module exists, both files read from it and nothing else
 * moves. The active row here is Google Ads, as in the reference.
 *
 * THE CATALOGUE IS A TABLE, NOT A DISCLOSURE LIST. The reference renders 24 `<details>` rows whose
 * summary carries the name and identifier and whose body carries category, format and description,
 * and it hides all of that behind a search box, a three-way type filter and a category `<select>`
 * -- every one of them driven by `extended.js`. This file is a server component and every other
 * file in the tree belongs to another agent, so a working filter cannot be split into a client
 * island this pass. Shipping the controls anyway would mean a search field that swallows
 * keystrokes and two filters that do nothing, which is worse than no control at all. So the same
 * data arrives as one table: every field, its identifier, type, category, format and description
 * visible at once, which is also what makes the browser's own find-in-page work across all 24
 * rows. The `<select>`'s taxonomy is not lost either -- it is rendered above the table as the
 * visible category index. This is a real data table, so it is marked up as one: `<th scope="col">`
 * on the header row, `<th scope="row">` on the field name, and a `<caption>` carrying the count.
 *
 * ON A PHONE the table keeps a 760px minimum and scrolls inside its own `overflow-x-auto` box, so
 * the page body never scrolls sideways. Five columns squeezed into 360px would wrap every
 * description to one word per line.
 *
 * COLOUR. The reference's doc chrome is a family of near-white blues over two hairline steps; none
 * of those literals is in the token file and each sits within a couple of percent of a token that
 * already carries the role, so the subtle surface takes the quiet boxes and the inset surface the
 * two that read as "blue" (the preview notice, the active source row). Two roles have no token at
 * all and take the nearest one: the dark code panel (`bg-surface-inverse`, the deep navy, against
 * the reference's slightly cooler #152236) and the metric badge, whose mint tint has no light
 * surface token and whose mint ink would fail AA as 10px text -- so the badge pair is
 * dimension = inset blue + accent ink, metric = subtle surface + muted ink, which keeps the two
 * types distinguishable without inventing a colour. Both are in the delivery note.
 *
 * INK. `--mp-ink-subtle` is documented as short of AA on the page ground, so it appears only
 * inside boxes that paint their own surface; prose on the page ground uses `text-ink-muted`.

/**
 * THE PASSWORD, EXCHANGED FOR THE COOKIE.
 *
 * A POST, never a GET with the password in the query string: a URL lands in browser history, in
 * server logs, and in the `Referer` header sent to every third party the next page loads.
 *
 * The comparison is constant-time and against the DERIVED token rather than the password, so the
 * same code path serves the form and a returning cookie. A wrong password is answered exactly like
 * a missing one, with no hint of how close it was.
 *
 * EVERY REDIRECT OUT OF HERE IS A 303, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE OF POST-REDIRECT-GET.
 * `NextResponse.redirect()` defaults to 307, which PRESERVES the method: the browser takes the
 * redirect and re-issues the POST against the destination. The destination is a page, a page route
 * has no POST handler, and the visitor -- who has just been authenticated, cookie and all -- is
 * shown `405 Method Not Allowed` instead of the site. 303 is the status that means "your POST
 * succeeded, now GET this instead", which is exactly what happened.
 *
 * This survived a round of live checks because `curl` was used to confirm the Set-Cookie header
 * and never told to follow the redirect the way a browser does. The test below follows it.

/**
 * THE GATE'S EXCHANGE, TESTED FOR ITS STATUS CODE AND NOT ONLY ITS COOKIE.
 *
 * This file exists because of a bug it would have caught on the first run. Every redirect out of
 * the route used `NextResponse.redirect(url)`, whose default is 307 -- a status that PRESERVES the
 * request method. So a correct password produced a 307 to `/`, the browser re-issued the POST
 * against a page route with no POST handler, and the visitor was shown `405 Method Not Allowed`
 * having just been authenticated. The cookie was set correctly the whole time, which is precisely
 * why checking the cookie was not enough.
 *
 * The live check that missed it used `curl` to read the Set-Cookie header without following the
 * redirect as a browser would. So the assertions here are on the STATUS, and every path out of the
 * route has one -- a wrong password and the not-gated case redirect too, and a 307 on either is
 * the same 405 in a different place.

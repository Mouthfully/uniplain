/**
 * THE OFFLINE RUN. Five normalisers, their committed fixtures, and the envelope schema, executed
 * at render.
 *
 * BE PRECISE ABOUT WHAT "OFFLINE" MEANS HERE, because the loose version of the claim is false.
 * Nothing on this path opens a socket, constructs a database client or reads a credential: the
 * normalisers are pure functions over a literal, and the fixtures are literals. The barrel does
 * bring each source's `client.ts` into the module graph, and those modules contain the `fetch`
 * calls -- none of them is reached, and none could be, because no client function is called and no
 * credential exists to call one with.
 *
 * This is step 10 of docs/marketplane/MVP-PLAN.md, and its job is to be the demo that still works
 * when a live connector does not. Nothing here is transcribed: every row on the page is whatever
 * `packages/connectors` produced from whatever `fixtures.ts` holds, this render. If a normaliser
 * changes, the page changes with it, and if a normaliser breaks, the page breaks rather than
 * showing a number that was true last week.
 *
 * WHY THE FIXTURES ARE IMPORTED BY RELATIVE PATH AND THE NORMALISERS ARE NOT. `@repo/connectors`
 * declares `exports: { ".": "./src/index.ts" }`, so the barrel is the only subpath a bare specifier
 * can reach, and the barrel exports clients, normalisers and backfills -- never fixtures. The
 * alternative was to add a `./fixtures` export (or fixture re-exports) to that package, which is
 * owned by concurrent work; a relative path costs nothing at build time here, because
 * `transpilePackages` being non-empty already makes Next compile every file under `packages/`.
 * If that package later publishes a fixtures subpath, these five lines become bare imports.
 *
 * THE INPUTS ARE EACH SOURCE'S OWN CONTRACT-TEST INPUTS, not new ones invented for a page. The
 * clocks (`fetchedAt`, `firstSeenAt`) decide `is_provisional` and `restates_until`, so choosing
 * them casually would put a made-up freshness state on screen -- WooCommerce's orders are dated
 * after GA4's fetch, and a shared `fetchedAt` would have the shop's orders arriving before they
 * were placed.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE IS A RECORDING. Every `fixtures.ts` in the repository says so in its own header:
 * the responses are synthetic, written from documented response shapes, because no credential for
 * any of the five platforms exists in this tree. The page says it too, because a demo that looks
 * like production data and is not is exactly the quiet wrong number this product is sold against.

/**
 * THE OFFLINE ENVELOPE PAGE, asserted rather than eyeballed.
 *
 * Two properties matter here and they pull in opposite directions, so both are checked.
 *
 * 1. THE ROWS ARE REAL. Not "a table rendered": the values on the page are the ones the five
 *    normalisers produced from their committed fixtures, and the schema accepted them. A test that
 *    only asserted "five panels appear" would pass against five hard-coded panels of invented
 *    numbers, which is precisely the failure this page exists to disprove.
 *
 * 2. THE REFUSAL IS THE SCHEMA'S. The error on the page is zod's issue list, and the assertion
 *    below rebuilds it from `envelopeRowSchema` here in the test rather than quoting a string. If
 *    someone replaces the printed error with a nicer sentence, this fails.
 *
 * Rendered with `renderToStaticMarkup` and read as text, which is how every other page in this app
 * is tested: the assertions are about what a reader sees, and a DOM would be bought for nothing.

/**
 * THE GA4 CONNECTOR PAGE, at /connectors/ga4. `app/integrations/page.tsx` already links here under
 * the Analytics category, which is the category `connectors.html` files Google Analytics under.
 *
 * THE LAYOUT IS `app/connectors/shopify/page.tsx`, DELIBERATELY AND ALMOST LINE FOR LINE: a hero
 * with the connector's mark and a panel beside it, the anchor strip, a destinations block, a "what
 * you can see" band, a data section, the numbered setup sequence, the `<details>` accordion and a
 * closing note. That page transcribes the supplied `shopify.html`, so matching it is how this page
 * inherits the design rather than inventing a second one. Section padding, heading sizes and the
 * two shared button class strings are copied from it on purpose; where the pages differ, the
 * difference is content. The sibling `connectors/google-ads/page.tsx` made the same choice, and the
 * shared class strings below are kept identical to it so the two cannot drift apart.
 *
 * ONE SECTION EXISTS HERE THAT NEITHER SIBLING HAS: `#window`. GA4 is the source whose restatement
 * clock and backfill module are the interesting facts about it, and burying either in an accordion
 * answer would have meant stating the number without the caveat Google attaches to it.
 *
 * WHERE EVERY CLAIM CAME FROM, because the failure this page is written against is a sibling
 * connector page that invented a catalogue of field names reading exactly like a real one. Nothing
 * below is written from memory of the GA4 API. Each constant carries the file it was read out of:
 *
 *   packages/connectors/src/sources/ga4/normalize.ts   GA4_METRIC_MAP, the entity type, the
 *                                                      dimensions block, the four traps, the nulls
 *   packages/connectors/src/sources/ga4/client.ts      the endpoint, paging, the page size, the
 *                                                      quota floor, whose quota it is
 *   packages/connectors/src/sources/ga4/backfill.ts    GA4_DEFAULT_REPORT, the inclusive date
 *                                                      range, the quota-stop rule
 *   packages/connectors/src/sources/ga4/fixtures.ts    every number in the hero panel
 *   packages/extract/src/backfill.ts                   planBackfill: how a date range is chunked
 *   packages/connections/src/connections.ts            PROVIDER_LANES.ga4 -> ["oauth"]
 *   packages/contract/src/restatement.ts               RESTATEMENT_CLOCKS.ga4 and its note
 *   packages/contract/src/metrics.ts                   the canonical metric names and their units
 *   packages/contract/src/registry.ts                  the GA4 field dispositions
 *   packages/oauth/src/providers.ts                    the scope, its sensitivity, the auth params
 *
 * ANYTHING NOT IN THOSE FILES IS NOT ON THIS PAGE. GA4 exposes hundreds of dimensions; this
 * connector reads one, and the page says one. A "channels and landing pages" line would have been
 * easy to justify from the scope description in `providers.ts` and would have been false about the
 * code, which is the exact shape of the mistake being avoided.
 *
 * THE PANEL SHOWS A FIXTURE, NOT AN INVENTED EXAMPLE. There is no supplied design for this
 * connector, so the panel renders the first row of `DAILY_SESSIONS` from `fixtures.ts` beside the
 * envelope fields `normalizeGa4Report` writes for it, including the fixture's own EUR and
 * Europe/Berlin. The chip says where the numbers came from, and `fixtures.ts` records that these
 * payloads are synthetic -- which is why the accordion says so too, rather than letting the panel
 * imply a live property.
 *
 * NO DESTINATION IS PROMISED THAT THIS BUILD DOES NOT HOLD. The Shopify page offers Sheets, Looker
 * Studio and BigQuery because its reference HTML does; nothing in this tree implements them, so the
 * block here points only at routes that exist in `apps/web/app`.
 *
 * COLOUR. No literal is written here. The gradient rule inside the panel is composed from the two
 * brand stops with Tailwind's gradient utilities, as on the Shopify page, and the closing panel
 * takes the pale-blue inset surface, which is the token that already carries "soft feature
 * background".

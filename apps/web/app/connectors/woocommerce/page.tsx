/**
 * THE WOOCOMMERCE CONNECTOR PAGE, at /connectors/woocommerce.
 *
 * IT IS MODELLED ON `connectors/shopify/page.tsx` AND SOURCED FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE ENTIRELY. The
 * layout is that page's -- hero with a mark, destinations, what you can see, a numbered setup
 * sequence, a closing note -- and the design reference behind it is `shopify.html`. But the
 * reference has no WooCommerce page, so there was nothing to transcribe, and the shape of the
 * failure that page records in its own FIELD_CATEGORIES comment is the one this file exists to
 * avoid: a catalogue of field names and descriptions that appear in no source, indistinguishable
 * at a glance from a real one.
 *
 * SO EVERY FACTUAL CLAIM BELOW IS READ OUT OF THE CONNECTOR, and each constant carries the file it
 * came from. The metrics are `sources/woocommerce/normalize.ts`; the entity and dimension shape is
 * the same file's `rows.push`; the credential lane is `PROVIDER_LANES` in
 * `packages/connections/src/connections.ts`; the restatement window and its note are
 * `RESTATEMENT_CLOCKS.woocommerce` in `packages/contract/src/restatement.ts`; the metric units are
 * `METRICS` in `packages/contract/src/metrics.ts`; the setup sequence is `scripts/seal-connection.ts`
 * and `sources/woocommerce/client.ts`; the timezone rule is the two migrations named on
 * SETUP_STEPS; what survives into the archive is `packages/payloads/src/redaction.ts`. Where a fact
 * is not published -- the product and customer entities -- the page says so instead
 * of filling the gap.
 *
 * THERE IS NO WOOCOMMERCE MARK IN `public/platforms`, AND THAT IS STATED RATHER THAN WORKED AROUND.
 * The directory ships artwork for thirteen platforms and this is not one of them. Borrowing a
 * neighbouring platform's file, or drawing something that resembles the real logo, would both be a
 * worse answer than a neutral tile: the first is wrong, the second is a trademark drawn from
 * memory. The hero and the flow panel use a token-coloured tile with a generic storefront glyph,
 * and MARK_NOTE at the foot of the page says why it is not the platform's own mark.
 *
 * THE FLOW PANEL CARRIES NO EXAMPLE FIGURES. `shopify.html`'s panel has an order count, a revenue
 * total and a refresh interval, and that page renders them because they are the design's own,
 * labelled as an example connection. Nothing equivalent exists for this connector, so the panel is
 * filled with the connection's actual contract instead -- lane, expiry, scopes, entity, window --
 * every line of which is a value a reader can go and find. Invented numbers in a panel labelled
 * "example" are still numbers a merchant plans around.
 *
 * THE DESTINATIONS BLOCK IS THE REFERENCE'S, TRANSCRIBED. Its four cards and their copy are
 * `shopify.html`'s `#destinations` section verbatim; they describe where reporting output goes and
 * make no claim about this connector, so they carry across unchanged.
 *
 * BUTTONS THAT OPENED A DIALOG GO SOMEWHERE INSTEAD. As on the Shopify page, the reference's
 * `data-connect-*` buttons become links to /dashboard: the label stays, only the destination moved.
 *
 * COLOUR. No literal is written here. The mint-to-blue rule in the flow panel is composed from the
 * two brand gradient stops with Tailwind's gradient utilities, and the closing panel takes the pale
 * blue inset surface, which is the token the brand guide gives to soft feature backgrounds -- both
 * the same substitutions the Shopify page recorded.

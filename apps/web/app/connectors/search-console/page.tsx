/**
 * THE SEARCH CONSOLE CONNECTOR PAGE, at /connectors/search-console. `app/integrations/page.tsx`
 * already links here from its Analytics tile, which is the category that page files this source
 * under.
 *
 * THE LAYOUT IS `app/connectors/shopify/page.tsx`, DELIBERATELY AND ALMOST LINE FOR LINE: a hero
 * with the connector's mark and a panel beside it, the anchor strip, a destinations block, a "what
 * you can see" band, a data section, a numbered setup sequence, the `<details>` accordion and a
 * closing note. That page transcribes the supplied `shopify.html`, so matching it is how this page
 * inherits the design rather than inventing a second one. Section padding, heading sizes and the
 * shared class strings are copied from it and from the sibling `connectors/ga4/page.tsx` on
 * purpose; where the pages differ, the difference is content.
 *
 * THERE IS NO MARK FOR THIS PLATFORM, AND THE PAGE SAYS SO RATHER THAN BORROWING ONE. No Search
 * Console file ships in `apps/web/public/platforms`, so the hero and the panel show a neutral tile
 * built from the theme's own surface and accent tokens, carrying the platform's initial -- the
 * same fallback `app/integrations/page.tsx` renders for an unmarked connector, and for the reason
 * its comment gives: a neutral tile is better than a broken image and better than another
 * company's artwork. The accordion states it in the page's own voice too, because a reader who
 * notices the missing logo deserves the reason rather than a guess.
 *
 * ONE SECTION EXISTS HERE THAT THE ECOMMERCE SIBLING HAS NO NEED OF: `#gap`. Two facts about this
 * source are more important than anything else on the page -- Google withholds rows from the query
 * grain, and nobody has measured how long a figure keeps moving -- and both are the kind of fact
 * that turns into a lie the moment it is summarised into a badge.
 *
 * WHERE EVERY CLAIM CAME FROM, because the failure this page is written against is a sibling
 * connector page that invented a catalogue of field names reading exactly like a real one. Nothing
 * below is written from memory of the Search Console API. Each constant carries the file it was
 * read out of:
 *
 *   packages/connectors/src/sources/search_console/normalize.ts
 *       SEARCH_CONSOLE_METRIC_MAP, SEARCH_CONSOLE_GRAINS, SEARCH_CONSOLE_DIMENSIONS,
 *       SEARCH_CONSOLE_NATIVE_ENTITY_TYPE, SEARCH_CONSOLE_ANONYMITY_THRESHOLDED,
 *       SEARCH_CONSOLE_CURRENCY, SEARCH_CONSOLE_TIMEZONE, grainFor's three refusals,
 *       parseSearchConsolePosition, totalsByDate, and every field the row object writes
 *   packages/connectors/src/sources/search_console/client.ts
 *       SEARCH_CONSOLE_API_BASE, searchAnalyticsUrl and its encoding note, the page sizes, the
 *       page cap, SEARCH_CONSOLE_DATA_STATE, the search type and its unsettled field name,
 *       SEARCH_CONSOLE_REPORTS, and the quota paragraph in the module comment
 *   packages/connectors/src/sources/search_console/fixtures.ts   every number in the hero panel
 *   packages/connections/src/connections.ts      PROVIDER_LANES.search_console -> ["oauth"]
 *   packages/contract/src/restatement.ts         RESTATEMENT_CLOCKS.search_console, its note, the
 *                                                WooCommerce comment it contrasts with, and what
 *                                                restatesUntil and isProvisional do with a null
 *   packages/contract/src/metrics.ts             METRICS.position: unit, aggregation, the naming
 *                                                decision, and combineMetric
 *   packages/contract/src/registry.ts            the Search Console field dispositions
 *   packages/oauth/src/providers.ts              the scope, its unconfirmed sensitivity, the auth
 *                                                params and why both are sent
 *
 * ANYTHING NOT IN THOSE FILES IS NOT ON THIS PAGE. Search Console offers dimensions this connector
 * does not map -- country, device and search appearance are named in `grainFor`'s refusal -- and
 * the page names them only as refusals, because that is all the code does with them. No field
 * catalogue is invented here; the two tables below are the metric map and the grain table, and
 * both are transcriptions.
 *
 * THE ABSENT MODULE IS STATED, NOT GLOSSED. `sources/search_console/` holds a client, a
 * normaliser, fixtures and tests, and no `backfill.ts`. Two source directories in this tree carry
 * one and this is not among them, so nothing here plans or walks a date range yet. The setup
 * section says so in the place a reader would otherwise assume a schedule.
 *
 * THE PANEL SHOWS A FIXTURE, NOT AN INVENTED EXAMPLE. It renders the first row of `BY_QUERY`
 * beside the envelope fields `normalizeSearchAnalytics` writes for it, including the fixture's own
 * reserved-TLD property. The chip says where the numbers came from, and `fixtures.ts` records that
 * these payloads are synthetic -- which is why the accordion says so too, rather than letting the
 * panel imply a live property.
 *
 * COLOUR. No literal is written here. The gradient rule inside the panel is composed from the two
 * brand stops with Tailwind's gradient utilities, as on both siblings, and the closing panel takes
 * the pale-blue inset surface, which is the token that already carries "soft feature background".

    question: "How long can a figure still change?",
    answer:
      "It is not published. The restatement clock for this source carries no window, which means unmeasured rather than absent, and an unknown window is treated as still open. No row from this source is marked final today.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why do the query rows not add up to the totals?",
    answer:
      "Because Google withholds queries made by too few people, and says nothing in the response about having done so. The date-only report returns its own total with those queries included, and the difference between the two reports is the size of what was withheld.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why is average position not simply averaged?",
    answer:
      "Because the platform's own figure is already weighted by impressions, so a plain mean of stored rows is a different number that looks entirely plausible. The dictionary declares the weighted mean and one helper implements it, rather than leaving every caller to remember.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I paste a token instead of signing in?",
    answer:
      "No. This provider offers the OAuth lane and nothing else, because Google issues no pasteable long-lived token and offering a lane a customer could never walk down would be a lie at the seam.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why is there no platform logo on this page?",
    answer:
      "Because no mark for this platform ships in this build. The tile in the hero is drawn from the theme's own colours and carries the initial, which is what the integrations grid does for an unmarked connector: better than a broken image, and better than borrowing another company's artwork.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are the example payloads real?",
    answer:
      "No. The fixtures are synthetic, written from the documented response shape, and the module says in its own comment that they must be replaced with a recording from a real property before this connector ships.",

/**
 * THE SHOPIFY CONNECTOR PAGE -- the supplied `shopify.html`, at /connectors/shopify.
 *
 * WHY THIS PAGE IS A SERVER COMPONENT EVEN THOUGH THE DESIGN SHOWS TWO SETS OF TABS. The reference
 * has two: the `.connector-tabs` strip under the hero, and the `.field-tabs` over the data
 * catalogue. The first is not a tab set at all -- it is five in-page anchors, so it is reproduced
 * exactly as the anchors it already is. The second IS stateful: `extended.js` swaps the contents of
 * `#shopify-field-panel` when Orders / Products / Customers is pressed, and neither that script nor
 * the rows it injects were supplied. Reproducing it honestly means `"use client"`, and a client
 * module cannot also `export const metadata`, so the interactive version needs a second file --
 * which this pass does not own. The three categories are therefore rendered as three stacked,
 * headed tables: every row is present, indexable and reachable without JavaScript, and a reader
 * loses a control rather than losing data. A tab bar that swallows clicks would be worse than
 * none, and the same trade is already recorded in `app/integrations/page.tsx` for its search field.
 *
 * THE ROWS THEMSELVES ARE NOT IN THE REFERENCE. See the FIELDS comment below; they are the one
 * block of copy on this page that could not be transcribed, and the reference's own closing note --
 * which IS verbatim -- is what keeps them honest by marking them as proposed reporting labels.
 *
 * THE HERO FLOW PANEL IS THE DESIGN'S, INCLUDING ITS NUMBERS. The order count, revenue and refresh
 * interval are the reference's example figures and are labelled as an example connection by the
 * chip above them, exactly as in the design. They are not presented as this app's live data.
 *
 * BUTTONS THAT OPENED A DIALOG NOW GO SOMEWHERE. The reference's two `data-connect-shopify`
 * buttons open a `<dialog>` driven by the missing script. Both become links to /dashboard, which is
 * the treatment every other transcribed section settled on: the label stays the design's, only the
 * destination moved, and it moves back the day a connect flow exists.
 *
 * COLOUR. No literal is written here. Three of the reference's values have no token and take the
 * nearest role instead: the mint-to-blue rule inside the flow panel is composed from the two brand
 * gradient stops with Tailwind's gradient utilities rather than from the fixed three-stop CSS
 * gradient; the sync strip's mint wash becomes the subtle surface with a mint status dot, because
 * mint is a decorative accent that the brand guide forbids for small text; and the closing panel's
 * blue-to-mint wash becomes the pale-blue inset surface, which is the token that already carries
 * "soft feature background". All three are reported.

/**
 * THE GOOGLE ADS CONNECTOR PAGE, at /connectors/google-ads.
 *
 * THE LAYOUT IS `app/connectors/shopify/page.tsx`, DELIBERATELY AND ALMOST LINE FOR LINE: hero with
 * the connector's mark and a panel beside it, a destinations block, a "what you can see" grid, the
 * numbered setup sequence, and a closing note. That page transcribes the supplied `shopify.html`,
 * so matching it is how this page inherits the design rather than inventing a second one. Section
 * padding, heading sizes, the anchor strip, the `<details>` accordion and the two shared button
 * class strings are all copied from it on purpose; where the two differ, the difference is content.
 *
 * WHERE EVERY CLAIM CAME FROM, because the earlier failure on a sibling connector page was a
 * catalogue of invented field names that read exactly like a real one. Nothing below is written
 * from memory of the Google Ads API. Each constant carries the file it was read out of:
 *
 *   packages/connectors/src/sources/google_ads/normalize.ts   metrics, grains, dimensions, the
 *                                                             attribution label, the zero rule
 *   packages/connectors/src/sources/google_ads/client.ts      the API version, the credentials a
 *                                                             request carries, paging, the budget
 *   packages/connectors/src/sources/google_ads/fixtures.ts    every number in the hero panel
 *   packages/connections/src/connections.ts                   PROVIDER_LANES.google_ads -> ["oauth"]
 *   packages/contract/src/restatement.ts                      RESTATEMENT_CLOCKS.google_ads
 *   packages/contract/src/metrics.ts                          the canonical metric names and units
 *   packages/extract/src/capacity.ts                          GOOGLE_ADS_TIERS
 *   docs/marketplane/MVP-PLAN.md                              the verification timing, quoted
 *
 * THE PANEL SHOWS A FIXTURE, NOT AN INVENTED EXAMPLE. The Shopify page's hero figures are the
 * supplied design's own example numbers. There is no supplied design for this connector, so rather
 * than make some up, the panel renders the first result of `DAILY_CAMPAIGNS` from `fixtures.ts`
 * beside the envelope fields `normalizeGoogleAdsSearch` writes for it -- including the THB currency
 * and the Asia/Bangkok zone the fixture deliberately uses. The chip says where it came from, and
 * `fixtures.ts` says in its own module comment that these payloads are synthetic, which is why the
 * closing accordion says so too rather than letting the panel imply a live account.
 *
 * NO DESTINATION IS PROMISED THAT THE REPOSITORY DOES NOT HOLD. The Shopify page's destinations
 * block offers Sheets, Looker Studio and BigQuery because its reference HTML does; nothing in this
 * tree implements or claims them, so this page's equivalent block points only at routes that exist
 * -- /dashboard, /docs, /fields/google-ads, /integrations -- and its cards use the same outline
 * marks as the use-case grid rather than borrowing platform artwork for a destination that is not
 * one.
 *
 * THE ONE THING THIS CONNECTOR CANNOT DO IS SAID PLAINLY AND ONCE. `sources/google_ads/` holds
 * `client.ts` and `normalize.ts` and no `backfill.ts`, while `ga4/` and `woocommerce/` both have
 * one. So there is nothing for a scheduler to call, the hero's third reassurance says so, and the
 * first question in the accordion answers it. No section implies a refresh interval.
 *
 * COLOUR. No literal is written here. The gradient rule inside the panel is composed from the two
 * brand stops with Tailwind's gradient utilities, as on the Shopify page, and the closing panel
 * takes the pale-blue inset surface for the same reason recorded there.

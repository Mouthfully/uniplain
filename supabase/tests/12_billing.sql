-- BILLING, AND THE ONE PROPERTY THAT MUST NOT BE A COMMENT.
--
-- `subscriptions` and `billing_customers` decide what a tenant may do and which Stripe customer
-- their money belongs to. Both are written ONLY by the billing webhook, through the service role.
-- If a tenant role can write either one, a customer can put themselves on the agency plan for
-- nothing, or point their organisation at someone else's billing record.
--
-- The migration says that in prose. This suite makes the database say it, because the prose was
-- true of the FIRST draft too -- which put `stripe_customer_id` on `organisations`, a table that
-- already grants `insert, update` on every column to `authenticated` and has an admin update
-- policy. The comment would have been just as confident and the hole just as open.
--
-- Four things are checked, and only the first is about the happy path:
--   1. A member can READ their own organisation's subscription and customer.
--   2. A member cannot read ANOTHER organisation's.
--   3. NO tenant role can insert, update or delete either table -- asserted per command, from the
--      catalogue, rather than by trying one statement and assuming the rest.
--   4. `current_plan` entitles what was paid for, including the two cases that are easy to get
--      backwards: a cancelled-but-paid-through subscription still entitles; `unpaid` does not.

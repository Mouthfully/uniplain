# Apply every migration to a scratch PostgreSQL database and run the RLS suite against it.
#
# `supabase start` needs Docker, which this environment does not have, and untested RLS is not
# worth much -- a policy that has never faced a hostile session is a comment. So this runs the real
# migrations, unmodified and in order, against a plain PostgreSQL 16 cluster, with 00_supabase_shim
# supplying the handful of objects a Supabase project would provide (the auth schema, the anon /
# authenticated / service_role roles, the extensions schema).
#
# What this does NOT cover, and where the real project still has to be checked: Supabase's own
# default privileges, GoTrue's actual JWT claim shape, Realtime, and anything storage-related.

# This was found by a mutation that should have failed and did not: deleting
# `grant app_ingest to authenticator` from a migration left the suite green, because the grant was
# still there from the PREVIOUS run. Every role below, and every membership between them, outlives
# `drop database` -- so without this the suite stops testing the migrations and starts testing the
# accumulated state of whoever's cluster it happens to run on. CI gets a fresh container and would
# have kept passing; a developer's machine would drift silently in the other direction.
#
# WHAT LEAKS IS THE MEMBERSHIPS, so those are revoked unconditionally and first. `grant app_ingest
# to authenticator` is the one the mutation exposed, and a revoke needs no cooperation from any
# other database: it is cluster state that this loop owns outright.

-- What `anon` can reach, asserted per table rather than inferred from a revoke.
--
-- THE ANON KEY IS PUBLIC. It ships in browsers; that is what it is for. So every privilege `anon`
-- holds in `public` is a privilege the internet holds, and the only correct number is zero: the
-- edge reaches the database as `authenticated` or through a `security definer` function, never as
-- `anon` against a table.
--
-- This file exists because the repository had two mechanisms for that and no assertion. Migration
-- 0700 revokes `on all tables in schema public` -- resolved at execution time, so it covered the
-- seven tables that existed then and missed `envelope_rows`, `restatement_events` and
-- `webhook_endpoints`, created in 1100 and 1200. Supabase's default privileges then granted `anon`
-- full DML on those three. Row-level security is why that was not a leak; it is not why it was not
-- a problem.
--
-- A privilege check is not a row-level-security check and does not replace `01_rls_isolation.sql`.
-- It is the layer underneath: RLS decides which rows a role may see, `has_table_privilege` decides
-- whether the role may address the table at all. The repository's stated posture is both, and
-- before this file only one of them was tested.

-- The anon-executable surface, ENUMERATED rather than asserted in a comment.
--
-- `anon` keeps EXECUTE on exactly two functions, and both are gated on the SHA-256 hash of an API
-- key: producing the argument IS the proof of possession, which is the only reason an `anon` grant
-- on a function that WRITES is defensible. Issue #19 is what that looks like when it is missing --
-- `consume_api_key_credits` took an `api_key_id`, a uuid that appears in logs, error payloads and
-- support tickets, so the whole authorisation for spending a tenant's monthly budget to its cap
-- was knowing an identifier. The anon key is public; it ships in browsers.
--
-- The invariant was WRITTEN DOWN in 20260908000800_api_key_verification.sql -- "the only
-- anon-executable function in the schema" -- and contradicted thirty lines below itself, because
-- nothing checked. So it is checked here, off `pg_proc`, and it fails on the THIRD function rather
-- than on a hand-written list somebody has to remember to update. That matters more than usual:
-- PostgreSQL's built-in default ACL grants EXECUTE on a new function to PUBLIC, `anon` is a member
-- of PUBLIC, and `alter default privileges` cannot revoke it -- so unlike tables, there is no
-- schema-level fix, and every function in `public` is anon-executable until its migration says
-- otherwise. This loop is the enforcement.
--
-- Two exclusions, both deliberate:
--   * Extension-owned functions. pgcrypto lives in `extensions` on a Supabase project, but
--     `run-local.sh` installs it before the migrations run, so locally its thirty `digest`,
--     `hmac` and `pgp_*` overloads sit in `public`. Counting them would report an anon surface
--     that does not exist in production and drown the two that do.
--   * Schema `app`. Its functions carry no ACL, so PUBLIC's built-in EXECUTE makes
--     `has_function_privilege` answer yes for every one of them -- and `anon` cannot call a single
--     one, because it holds no USAGE on the schema. Asserted below rather than assumed, since the
--     exclusion is only honest while that stays true.

--
-- RAISED FROM 93 TO 103 by 20260912000800_scheduler_entry_point.sql, which added ten: three
-- functions times "app_scheduler may", "anon may not" and "authenticated may not", plus the
-- `authenticator` membership without which PostgREST cannot assume the role at all. The floor is
-- raised with the assertions rather than left where it was, because the whole value of a floor is
-- that it notices a block that stopped running.

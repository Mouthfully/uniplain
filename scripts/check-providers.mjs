/**
 * THE PROVIDER GUARD.
 *
 * `20260908000500_connections.sql` asked for this in a comment and then shipped without it:
 *
 *   "NOTE FOR WHOEVER ADDS THE NEXT ONE: no guard relates this enum to its TypeScript twin.
 *    check-dictionary.mjs covers sources, entity types, attribution windows and metrics -- NOT
 *    connection providers. Adding a member here and forgetting the other side fails at runtime,
 *    not at build time, which is the failure mode that guard exists to prevent everywhere else."
 *
 * It had already happened by the time anyone looked. `app.connection_provider` carries `impact`,
 * `awin`, `cj` and `partnerstack`; `ConnectionProvider` names none of them. Those four are a
 * planned set written into an enum ahead of the code, which is harmless -- a row cannot acquire a
 * provider no code can write. The dangerous direction is the other one, and it is what this guard
 * makes impossible: a provider TypeScript can name and the database cannot store fails on the
 * INSERT, in production, after the customer has already finished authorising.
 *
 * So the asymmetry is the design, not an accommodation:
 *
 *   TypeScript -> database   must be total. A name the column cannot hold is a build failure.
 *   database -> TypeScript   may have a surplus, but the surplus is ENUMERATED here with a reason.
 *                            A member added to the enum and forgotten fails the build too; only a
 *                            member added to this list on purpose does not.
 *
 * The same applies to `app.credential_lane` and `CredentialLane`, where equality IS required in
 * both directions: unlike providers, there is no planned set, and a lane the database cannot
 * store is a connection that cannot be written.
 *
 * IT ALSO ENFORCES ONE COMMENT. `08_credential_lane.sql` tests the lane backfill by re-running the
 * migration's `update` against rows it inserts itself, because a backfill cannot be observed after
 * the fact -- the migration runs against an empty table in a scratch database, so its own execution
 * proves nothing. That means the statement exists twice, and the test says "Verbatim from
 * 20260912000100_credential_lane.sql" about a copy nothing compared. Edit the mapping in the
 * migration alone and the test goes on passing while the migration is wrong, which is the exact
 * false-pass this repository keeps finding. So the two are compared here, whitespace-insensitively.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/check-providers.mjs [--warn]

/**
 * THE SINGLE-FILE ASSUMPTION IS OVER HERE TOO, AND `check-dictionary.mjs` GOT THERE FIRST.
 *
 * This guard read ONE migration per enum and compared its `create type` body against TypeScript.
 * That held only while a declaration could still be edited in place -- and it cannot: a database
 * has applied these migrations, so a new member arrives as `alter type ... add value` in a LATER
 * file. `20260913000300_loyverse_provider.sql` is the first one, and against the unfolded guard it
 * read as the most alarming failure this script can report -- "PROVIDER_LANES names loyverse,
 * which app.connection_provider cannot store" -- about a column that stores it perfectly well.
 *
 * A guard that goes red when the thing it guards is CORRECT is worse than no guard: it teaches
 * people that red means "add it to the excuse list". So the fold is the one `check-dictionary.mjs`
 * already performs, deliberately in the same shape, so the two cannot come to disagree about what
 * folding means:
 *
 *   ACCUMULATE  enum members are additive. A later `alter type ... add value` contributes.
 *
 * There is no LAST WINS case here, because this guard reads no function bodies or constraints --
 * only enum declarations and one `update` statement, which is compared verbatim and not folded.
 *
 * A `DROP` OR `RENAME` ON AN ENUM IS REFUSED RATHER THAN FOLDED, for `checkNoMetricDrops`'s
 * reason: accumulation is sound only while migrations are additive, and a removal folded into
 * "still present" is exactly the silent pass both guards exist to prevent. PostgreSQL has no
 * `alter type ... drop value` at all, so the only reachable form is `rename value`.
